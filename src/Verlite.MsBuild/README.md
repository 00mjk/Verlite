Automatically set and embed versions for your SDK-style projects computed via [SemVer 2][semver-2] Git tags.

For Continuous Delivery workflows.

## Quickstart

Simply add the following to your project, being sure to set the desired version:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="Verlite.MsBuild" Version="x.y.z" PrivateAssets="All" />
</ItemGroup>
```

Additionally, to access the embedded version generated by the source generator:

```cs
Console.WriteLine(Verlite.Version.Full);
```
